This project involved the development of an AI algorithm that could detect COPD, asthma, COVID-19, and healthy, via forced cough recordings.
The algorithm was developed by **Ashley Mo** (Caltech CS '27) and **Emma Gui** (Waterloo SWE '28) in collaboration with Dr. Richard Fletcher from MIT's Mobile Tech Lab.

An app with an intuitive user interface was also developed to enable the practical implementation of the algorithm. The app was developed by **Ashley Mo** and **Aoi Otani** (Harvard Bio/CS '25).
